# prefect-agent-on-ecs
Project demonstrating how to automate Prefect 2.0 deployments to AWS ECS

The project is meant as monorepo to make it easier to develop new project and manage access to a single repository

Assumption:
- dev = either a separate Cloud 2.0 workspace or a self-hosted Orion
- prod = Cloud 2.0 (free version is sufficient)
