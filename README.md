# prefect-agent-on-ecs
Project demonstrating how to automate Prefect 2.0 deployments to AWS ECS

The project can be used both as monorepo or as a template for a per-project repository

Assumption:
- dev = either a separate Cloud 2.0 workspace or a self-hosted Orion
- prod = Cloud 2.0 (free version is sufficient) 

The environment in this branch can be used as production environment
